# my-projects
Here are some of the cool projects I've worked on so far! Since I made a couple projects through my Data Structures course, I am unable to upload those projects here, but I would be more than glad to show you them in person or email them to you!

Text Editor Project
- Designed and built a text editor with features such as word wrap, arrow keys, mouse clicking, and undo/redo. Effectively implemented such features within runtime constraints by designing a custom linked list based data structure.

Linked List Deque
- Built a Linked List with front and back sentinels to ensure efficient runtimes

ArrayList Deque
- Built an Arraylist with circular topology that could run basic methods efficiently and resize when necessary.

California Water Usage
- Utilized data procured from the California State Water Resources Control Board and the IRS to explore possible connections between water usage, geography, and income in California.
