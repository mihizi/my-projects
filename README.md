# my-projects
Here are some of the cool projects I have worked on! Since I made a few projects through my courses, I am unable to upload those projects here, but I would be more than happy to discuss them or give a demo in person!

WAN Optimizer
- Built a middlebox application that optimizes the amount of data transmitted over a wide area network (WAN).

Chat
- Utilized sockets to create a simple chat server which allows users to join and leave channels.

Distance-Vector Routing
- Designed an implementation of distance-vector routing, a distributed routing algorithm where multiple routers cooperate to transport packets to their destinations efficiently. 

Text Editor Project
- Designed and built a text editor with features such as word wrap, arrow keys, mouse clicking, and undo/redo. Effectively implemented such features within runtime constraints by designing a custom linked list based data structure.

BearMaps
- Implemented rastering of images to create a map of UC Berkeley that users could explore. Implemented variation of A* algorithm to create a routing function that highlights the fastest driving route between any two locations.

California Water Usage
- Utilized data procured from the California State Water Resources Control Board and the IRS to explore possible connections between water usage, geography, and income in California.
